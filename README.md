## @2utils/is-equal

An ordinary isEqual function.

```
npm i @2utils/is-equal
```

## Test
Tests were brazenly stolen from ```lodash```

- [x] should compare primitives
- [x] should compare arrays
- [x] should treat arrays with identical values but different non-index properties as equal
- [x] should compare sparse arrays
